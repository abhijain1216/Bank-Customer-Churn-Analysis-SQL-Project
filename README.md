# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis-SQL-Project


### *Project Objective*
The objective of the Bank Customer Churn SQL project is to analyze customer behaviour and identify factors contributing to customer attrition. By leveraging SQL queries on a structured dataset, this project aims to extract meaningful insights into customer demographics, account activities, transaction patterns, and service interactions. The primary goal is to detect trends, flag high-risk customers, and pinpoint key indicators of churn. Ultimately, the insights will assist the bank in developing focused retention strategies, increasing customer satisfaction, and minimizing overall churn rates by addressing the root causes of customer disengagement.


### *Project Summary*
A bank customer churn analysis was conducted using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. Three new tables were added to the database: active_customer, credit_card, and exit_customer. The tables were loaded into PostgreSQL and the analysis was performed entirely in PostgreSQL. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted, and useful insights were derived. Recommendations were then made to reduce customer churn. The analysis revealed that incentives need to be offered to customers who are at risk of churning, such as discounts, additional benefits, or personalized outreach. This includes customers with Fair or Poor credit scores, inactive customers, customers with credit cards, customers in Germany or France, customers who only use one product, customers who have been with the bank for 1 year, and customers in the age group of 41-50 and with a balance of 100,000-150,000.
